First, of course, I shoo Alward away from the crystal, telling him quite truthfully that it is merely the ghostly echo of a glass replacement, which was broken during a gentleman's duel, of the original crystal, which was sold for fuel and food after the bad business with the toads. 

Arras insists we search the master's study, though he will not tell me what for. He finds a faded and worn occult artwork. I suggest he might sell it, perhaps Pitch, who runs a side trade in such things, might pay a gold coin or so for it. He does not seem to care one way or the other, he inspects it, perhaps for runes, and stuffs it into his jacket. The whole business leaves him quite drained. No doubt he had expected more. 

I insist we must address the master's many debts, perhaps we might start with finding the paperwork requested by Holpine, so to get it out of the way. 

On the stairs, of course, our way is blocked by Constable Tume, who insists that he must receive 67 crowns without delay. He is wide enough none of us can pass, and he holds out a black sack, his gaze firm and insistent. 

Baston steps forward and insists he shall personally deliver such quantity of crowns to Tume's office tomorrow, suggesting, in his cool mechanical voice, that the Constable need not inconvenience himself by staying any longer. 

The constable coughs and says, "yes, surely, of course you will, I'll just be, then, back to the, yes, surelyâ€¦" he backs down the stairs while scrambling to stuff the pouch into a pocket, not seeming to have a particular pocket in mind.
